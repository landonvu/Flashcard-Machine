NOTE: This is my first ever program so expect a lot of bugs throughout the program. If you wish to, feel free to edit the code in a separate file by going to the link on the second step in the "How to download" section, and copying and pasting it into a different file. I will create more programs that do various things while also keeping track of this program to see if any improvements are avaliable that I find, or is recommended to me. Thank you for trying this out!
